DPI(Deep Packet Inspection) demo.

This demo demonstrates how to write a wireshark plugin with simple DPI function.
By now, I just run & test this demo on Windows 11 with Visual Studio 2019 installed.

See my article https://www.yuque.com/zzqcn/wireshark/snyg6w for details.

Features
=========

- It's a post-dissector
- Match HTTP Host field with DPI rules
- Support multiple regex matching by hyperscan
- Show DPI result in proto tree panel
- Support user-defined rule file

Rule Syntax
============

DPI rule file syntax:

- Should be UTF8 text file
- Must be in wireshark home directory at runtime(e.g. D:\tools\Wireshark,
  or D:\dev\opensource\wireshark-build\run\Debug)
- One rule per line
- Comment character is '#'
- Seperator characters between fields are ", \t\r\n"
- Every rule includes 4 field: {id, regex, priority, name},
  - id: must be unique
  - regex: regex for matching HTTP Host field, pay attention to escape characters
  - priority: should be unique
  - name: string to show when regex matched

Rule sample file 'rules.txt' is in current directory.

Compile
========

Before compiling, you should build or install hyperscan first, and adjust CMakeLists.txt
depend on your situation.
