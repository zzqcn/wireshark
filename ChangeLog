commit f52abd7
Author: Christopher Maynard <Christopher.Maynard@igt.com>
Date:   Sat Jun 6 20:04:42 2015 -0400

    Fix insertion of subnets read from the subnets file: append to the *end* of
    the list.
    
    The patch ensures that non-duplicate subnets are appended to the end of the
    list rather than as the second element, which if there had been a second
    element previously, the memory for it was effectively leaked.
    
    It also allows /32 "subnets", even though arguably the hosts file should be
    used instead, but now the test in read_subnets_file() matches the assert in
    subnet_entry_set().

    WCCP: Fix up storing and decoding of IP addresses.
    
    Try to decode as many IP addresses as we can, even if they don't fit in the
    table we store them in.
    
    Only add IP addresses in the table once.  We could theoretically reallocate
    the table but the original code seems to assume the addresses should (in
    non-fuzzed captures) only show up once per PDU.  This part of the change fixes
    the fuzz failure.

    Don't use the ServiceManagement framework when building for 10.5.
    
    The 10.5 SDK doesn't have that framework, so we can't use it.
    
    All three people for whom it's important that they be able to upgrade
    their Leopard box, running Wireshark, release by release, all the way up
    to Yosemite, and have Wireshark repair the damage done by the Yosemite
    installer to the XQuartz installation a previous upgrade required, cried
    bitter tears.

    Pop up error dialogs and quit if we don't have a working X11.
    
    If XQuartz is missing the /usr/X11 symlink but the user doesn't allow us
    to fix it, don't try to run Wireshark.
    
    If the OS has X11 bundled but the user didn't install it, let them know,
    and don't try to run Wireshark.
    
    We should probably just say "your X11/XQuartz is hosed" for other
    problem cases.
    
    Get rid of some debugging fprintfs while we're at it.

    Have Wireshark.app try to fix broken XQuartz installations.
    
    If the user had a pre-Yosemite system with XQuartz installed, and
    upgraded to Yosemite, the Yosemite installer will have removed the
    /usr/X11 symlink.  If we have /opt/X11 but not /usr/X11, ask the user if
    we should fix the XQuartz installation and, if they say to do so, run a
    little helper as root in order to re-install the symlink.

    Don't just blindly tell application X11 to do anything.
    
    Determine what type of X11 (bundled from Apple, unbundled XQuartz) we
    should have and what type we do have.
    
    If we don't have any installed, don't tell X11 to do anything, as that
    just pops up a "where is X11?" dialog; that's information the user
    shouldn't need to tell the system if it is installed, and it's
    information for which the user shouldn't be asked if it's not installed
    - and if they're asked, they might answer incorrectly, leaving a system
    that doesn't properly launch X11 for Wireshark.  (See various
    ask.wireshark.org questions about this, for example.)
    
    Pick up some changes from newer versions of Inkscape, such as using
    unsigned char *, not using FSSpecs, and adding some comments, while
    we're at it.
